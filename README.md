# MLU-09-Iris-DecisionTree

**About**<br>
The iris samples in question fall into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. At first glance, the three species can look remarkably like each other, and this is especially the case for the latter two. However, thanks to the careful measurements taken and presented by Anderson and Fisher, an individual sample may be classified with a high degree of accuracy via machine learning models if the relevant measurements are taken.

**Dataset**<br>
Load from <br> 
sklearn.datasets import load_iris<br>
iris = load_iris()

**Objective**<br>
- To visualize the decision process in a simple flowchart to trace the rational of every assignment made by a decision tree model
- using graphviz
